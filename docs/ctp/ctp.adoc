This is a draft Certification Test Plan.  It reflects the coverpoints and tests
presently being developed in the https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw-arch-verif/[cvw-arch-verif] repository soon to migrate to
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test[riscv-arch-test] cvw branch.  It is intended for discussion as a possible format
of test plan for RISC-V Certification.

== Introduction

This Certification Test Plan describes the coverpoints and tests to certify RISC-V profiles.  It summarizes the profiles intended to be supported and the test suites that need to run on each profile.  It also summarizes the contents of each test suite.

=== Coverpoints and Tests

Coverpoints are the key to certification.  They are the features of the RISC-V architecture that need to be tested in order to certify a profile.  Each coverpoint has a set of tests that exercise it, and each test has a set of coverpoints that it hits.

This test plan defines the coverpoints that must be hit for each profile, and outlines the tests that hit those coverpoints.  The tests are self-checking, and report pass/fail results.  The coverage report confirms that the tests hit all the coverpoints.

Coverpoints are written in SystemVerilog, and are designed to be used with the Extended https://github.com/riscv-verification/RVVI[RISC-V Verification Interface] (RVVI).  They are written to be independent of the DUT (Device Under Test), so that they can be used with any RISC-V implementation. footnote:[Extended RVVI adds signals for virtual memory verification, including physical and virtual instruction and data addresses, and I/D TLB entries.] Functional coverage is collected using SystemVerilog infrastructure adapted from https://github.com/riscv-verification/riscvISACOV[riscvISACOV] footnote:[Portions of riscvISACOV that depend on proprietary Synopsys code such as a disassembler have been replaced with open-source equivalents].

Coverpoints are organized into .svh SystemVerilog coverage files, each of which contain one or more covergroups, each of which contain one or more coverpoints.  Coverage files apply to a DUT with a particular set of extensions.  For example, the I_coverage.svh coverage file is used for any 32 or 64-bit DUT that supports the I extension. The ZicsrM_coverage.svh coverage file applies to a DUT that supports the Zicsr extension and machine mode.  The ZicsrS_coverage.svh coverage file applies to a DUT that supports the Zicsr extension and supervisor mode.

Tests are written in assembly language .S files.Tests are organized into directories for each extension, and into a privileged directory.  The coverpoints are hit by running all of the applicable tests in a directory.  For example, RV32I coverage involves running add.S, addi.S, sub.S, etc.  RV64I coverage also involves running addw.S, which is unique to RV64.

=== Glossary

The following terms are used in this test plan:

* Extensions: named and ratified RISC-V extensions, such as RV32I, M, Zbb, or Zicsr.

* Parameters: options describing the behavior of extensions.  Parameters may or may not have an official RISC-V name.  For example, the Sm machine mode extension defines
Physical Memory Protection, which has a named parameter G defining the granularity and an unnamed parameter indicating 0, 16, or 64 PMP regions.  The Sv* virtual memory extensions have additional Svade and Svadu extensions, which are parameters defining whether setting the Accessed and Dirty bits is done with a page fault exception or by the Hardware Page Table Walker. There is a completely unnamed parameter defining whether misaligned exceptions have higher or lower priority than access-fault exceptions.
Parameters will eventually all have formal names in UDB when they are all identified.

* Configuration: A set of extensions and parameters partially or fully describing the behavior of a RISC-V hart.  A full configuration is sufficient for a reference model to exactly match the behavior of a DUT except with regard to non-deterministic behaviors.

* Non-deterministic Behaviors: behaviors that are unpredictable despite a full configuration.  For example, a tail-agnostic vector instruction might copy vector elements from the source, or might provide elements that are all 1s.  Either behavior is correct, and the hart might change behaviors from one instruction to the next, so the DUT and reference model cannot be guaranteed to exactly match.  Self-checking tests must accept all legal outcomes for non-deterministic behaviors.

* Profile: A named collection of required and optional extensions, such as RVI20 or RVA23S64.  Profiles may be ratified by RISC-V or developed by the Certification Steering Committee to meet certification market needs, such as a simple microcontroller. A profile is a partial configuration.  The test plan must allow the DUT configuration to indicate which optional extensions and other parameters are used, and fully test all optional profile extensions provided by the DUT.


* UDB: https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db[Unified Database], a standardized way to describe the configurat***

* Coverage files: a SystemVerilog .svh file containing all of the covergroups for an extension or combination of extensions, such as I_coverage.svh or ZfaD_coverage.svh.

* Covergroup: A SystemVerilog construct that contains one or more coverpoints.  Covergroups are used to collect functional coverage of a particular feature or set of features in the RISC-V architecture.  For example, the I_coverage.svh file contains a covergroup for each instruction in the I extension, such as add, addi, sub, etc.  ***privileged example

* Coverpoint: A SystemVerilog construct describing a set of conditions to test.  For example, the cp_rd coverpoint checks that all 32 destination registers x0-x31 are exercised by instructions that don't trap. Each coverpoint has one or more bins; for example, cp_rd has 32 bins for the different registers.

* Bin: One target value for a coverpoint.  Each bin may be covered or not by a test suite.

* Test files: A file containing one or more tests, typically written in assembly language.  For example, rv32/I/add.S contains all of the RV32 tests to exercise the add_cg covergroup in I_coverage.svh.

* Tests: A program, typically a sequence of assembly language instructions, that exercises at least one bin of a coverpoint.

* Test Suite: A collection of coverage and test files to test a particular extension, combination of extensions, or group of extensions.  For example, the RV32I test suite contains the I_coverage.svh coverage file and the rv32/I/add.S, addi.S, sub.S, and other tests files with tests that hit the coverpoints in that coverage file.  The RV64ZfaD test suite contains the ZfaD_coverage.svh coverage file and the rv64/ZfaD/fround.d.S, and other tests files with tests that hit the coverpoints in that coverage file.  The RVA23S64 test suite contains all of the required and selected optional test suites for the profile, incluidng RV64I, RV64ZfaD, ExceptionsS, etc.

[NOTE]
====
Beware that Test Suite is also used outside this document to mean a full set of tests for a given profile from a given provider.  For example, Synopsys, Breker, and riscv-arch-test all have test suites for the RVI20U32 profile.
====


== Certification Process

Certifying a RISC-V Device-Under-Test (DUT) involves the following steps:

* Selecting a profile for the DUT
* Providing a Unified Database (UDB) configuration for the DUT, such as optional extensions, peripheral addresses, and PMP granularity
* Generating self-checking tests based on the selected profile and UDB
* Running the tests and reporting pass/fail

Test developers also need to
* Generate a coverage report confirming that the tests hit all the coverpoints footnote:[Open question whether to generate coverage from a Sail log or the DUT.  DUT requires a suitable testbench with RVVI interface, but is more robust to check that the tests fully run.]

== Profiles & Test Suites

This test plan addresses Phase 0, Phase 1, and Phase 2 RISC-V certification objectives, including the following ratified and unratified profiles:

* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kg7Ner5ZlxFDclf92-9Tz88JvmZWt5Wb/view[RVI20 Profile] (Ratified)
** RV{32/64}IMAFDC_Zifencei_Zicntr_Zihpm with machine mode
* Microcontroller Profile (Not Ratified, but market demand)
** RV{32/64}IMZca_Zcb_Zifencei_Zicsr_Zicntr with machine mode, user mode, interrupts, PMP16 footnote:[Tentative; may need updating based on the MRD Market Requirements Document]
* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/src/rvb23-profile.adoc#rvb23s64-profile[RVB23S64 Profile] (Ratified)

* https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/src/rva23-profile.adoc#rva23s64-profile[RVA23S64 Profile] (Ratified)

<<t-profiles>> summarizes the coverage files applicable to each profile. x indicates a mandatory extension, and o indicates an optional extension.  The certification test plan handles all mandatory and optional extensions.

Coverage files with multiple extensions in the name apply when all the extensions are supported; for example, ZfaZfhD is used in a system supporting Zfa, Zfh, and D extensions.

== General Test Plan Strategy

Coverpoints are written with one file that covers both RV32 and RV64, to reduce the duplication and risk of becoming out of sync.  When a coverage file contains coverpoints that apply only to one XLEN or the other (e.g. 32 or 64-bit corner values), they are separated by ``ifdef XLEN32` or `XLEN64` directives.

Privileged tests are mostly written by hand and share a single .S file that can be compiled for either RV32 or RV64, again with `ifdef` directives to separate the two.  Unprivileged tests are generated from a template using a Python script, and are divided into RV32 and RV64 directories because the random values differ with XLEN.

=== Configuration

* UDB
* Profiles, options, configuration parameters
* Other parameters: PMP entries, PMP granularity

=== Unspecified and Reserved Behaviors

Some RISC-V behaviors are UNSPECIFIED, which means an implementation can do anything. These behaviors are not tested because there is no wrong answer. <<t-behavior-normative-statements>> summarizes the normative statements regarding reserved behaviors.

Unimplemented opcodes (except in the custom space) and instructions accessing non-existent CSRs are reserved.  The behavior of reserved instructions is UNSPECIFIED, so they should not be tested by most testplans.  However, when the Ssstrict extension is enabled, reserved instructions raise an illegal instruction exception that results in a contained trap to the supervisor-mode trap handler.  This is tested by the Ssstrict test plan.

[[t-behavior-normative-statements]]
.I Normative Statements Regarding Behaviors
[cols="1, 4" options=header]
|===
|Spec Section|Normative Statement
|Unpriv 1.7|The term UNSPECIFIED refers to a behavior or value that is intentionally unconstrained.
|Unpriv 2.2|For this purpose, we divide each RISC-V
instruction-set encoding space (and related encoding spaces such as the CSRs) into three disjoint
categories: standard, reserved, and custom. ... Reserved encodings are currently not defined but are saved for future standard extensions; once thus used, they become standard encodings. ... The behavior upon decoding a reserved instruction is UNSPECIFIED.
|Privileged 2.1|Instructions that access a non-existent CSR are reserved.
|https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/src/rva23-profile.adoc#rva23s64-profile[rva23-profile]|Ssstrict No non-conforming extensions are present. Attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes or access unimplemented CSRs in the standard or reserved encoding spaces raises an illegal instruction exception that results in a contained trap to the supervisor-mode trap handler.
|===

=== CSR Bitfields

CSR fields can be Write Preserves, Read Ignores (WPRI), Write Legal, Read Legal (WLRL), or Write Any, Read Legal (WARL). Examples of WPRI fields include undefined fields of `xstatus`, `xenvcfg`, `mseccfg`, and `xstateen*` that could have unintended side effects if they are subsequently defined and unwittingly set to nonzero values. Examples of WLRL fields include `xcause.ExceptionCode` and `hstatus.VGEIN`.  Other CSR fields are generally WARL.

WPRI and WLRL fields require careful testing ***.  WARL fields can be tested by trying all possible values of the field.  CSR tests (<<***>>) generally involve setting all bits to 1, setting all to 0, and writing walking 1s.   Therefore, they inherently exercise all possible values of 1 and 2-bit WARL fields.  Longer fields can be tested exhaustively if the number of possibilities is small (such as `satp.MODE`), or just with walking 1s if the number of possibilities is too large (such as `misa.EXTENSIONS`).

<<t-bitfield-normative-statements>> summarizes the normative statements regarding CSR bitfields.

[[t-bitfield-normative-statements]]
.I Normative Statements Regarding Bitfields
[cols="1, 4" options=header]
|===
|Spec Section|Normative Statement
|Privileged 2.3|Some whole read/write fields are reserved for future use. Software should ignore the values read from
these fields, and should preserve the values held in these fields when writing values to other fields of
the same register. For forward compatibility, implementations that do not furnish these fields must
make them read-only zero. These fields are labeled *WPRI* in the register descriptions.
|Privileged 2.3|Some read/write CSR fields specify behavior for only a subset of possible bit encodings, with other bit encodings reserved. Software should not write anything other than legal values to such a field, and
should not assume a read will return a legal value unless the last write was of a legal value, or the
register has not been written since another operation (e.g., reset) set the register to a legal value.
These fields are labeled *WLRL* in the register descriptions.
|Privileged 2.3|Implementations are permitted but not required to raise an illegal-instruction exception if an
instruction attempts to write a non-supported value to a *WLRL* field. Implementations can return
arbitrary bit patterns on the read of a *WLRL* field when the last write was of an illegal value, but the
value returned should deterministically depend on the illegal written value and the value of the field
prior to the write.
|Privileged 2.3|Some read/write CSR fields are only defined for a subset of bit encodings, but allow any value to be
written while guaranteeing to return a legal value whenever read. Assuming that writing the CSR has no
other side effects, the range of supported values can be determined by attempting to write a desired
setting then reading to see if the value was retained. These fields are labeled *WARL* in the register
descriptions.
|Privileged 2.3|Implementations will not raise an exception on writes of unsupported values to a *WARL* field.
Implementations can return any legal value on the read of a *WARL* field when the last write was of an
illegal value, but the legal value returned should deterministically depend on the illegal written value
and the architectural state of the hart.
|===

== Unprivileged Test Plan

Unprivileged tests exercise every instruction using every applicable source and destination register, and reasonable corners of source values.  They are intended for certification, not verification. For example, they do not test all difficult floating-point cases.

The unprivileged test plan is written to be easily reviewed by a human, and to be automatically converted to machine-readable coverpoints and tests.
It is defined with spreadsheets in comma-separated value (CSV) format.

=== Unprivileged Tests

Unprivileged tests sweep some feature under test (such as the destination register rd) while randomizing all applicable register IDs and source values (including values to be loaded from memory).  For example, the unprivileged test for the cp_rd coverpoint of the add instruction contains 32 add instructions, using the 32 different choices of rd.  The rs1 and rs2 register numbers and values are selected randomly. <<Appendix A: Examples>> gives examples of unprivileged coverpoints and tests meeting these requirements and the coverpoints of <<t-I-coverpoints>> for the `add` instruction.

[NOTE]
====
The random values are preferably selected in a deterministic way so that regenerating tests use the same random values where possible, minimizing differences between tests.  This can be done by seeding the random number generator with a has of the instruction and coverpoint name.
====

Unprivileged tests are designed to never trap. Their results are independent of the privilege mode in which they are run, so they generally are run only in machine mode.  They generally involve no privileged instructions, except that floating-point and vector tests turn on the mstatus.{FS/VS} bits to enable these extensions.

=== Unprivileged Coverpoints

The coverpoints in <<t-unprivileged-coverpoints>> are used in most of the unprivileged test plans in subsequent sections.

Notes:

* These coverpoints are adapted from the Imperas https://github.com/riscv-verification/riscvISACOV[riscvISACOV] functional coverage project.

* Register number is a 5-bit ID (e.g. x7), while register value is an `XLEN`-sized number.

* Most coverpoints typically have 32 bins because they exercise all 32 integer registers.

* Cross-products exercise all combinations of two or more coverpoints. They can have a large number of bins.

* The cmp_*_eqval coverpoints are automatically hit by the cr_rs1_rs2_corners tests and do not require additional tests.

* Each of these coverpoints can optionally have a modifer appended.  For example, cp_rs1_nx0 is a modified version of cp_rs1, covering all 31 rs1 register numbers excluding x0.  It is used for load/store/jalr instructions that can't rely on address 0 specified by x0 being legal. Modifiers are defined in the extensions that they apply to.

* The cmp_* and cp_*_hazard coverpoints occupy the fuzzy land at the edge of certification and verification.  They are included because they are easy.

[NOTE]
====
The register corner cases are selected to include extreme values and their immediate neighbors.  They also include walking 1s and a random number to exercise intermediate values.  RV64 adds corners near the 32-bit boundary to stress W-type instructions.  Immediate corners exercise each bit of the immediate and the extreme corners and one random intermediate value.

=== I Extension

<<t-I-coverpoints>> summarizes the coverpoints for the I extension.  The Type column is used to generate tests with the appropriate operands. An x in the RV32 or RV64 colunn indicates that the instruction is supported in that XLEN.  The remaining columns refer to coverpoints defined in <<t-unprivileged-coverpoints>>.

|Unpriv Section|Normative Statement|Coverpoints
|2.1|For RV32I, the 32 `x` registers are each 32 bits wide, i.e., `XLEN=32`.| cp_rs1, cp_rs2, cp_rd, cp_rs1_corners
|2.1|Register `x0` is hardwired with all bits equal to 0.|cp_rs1, cp_rs2, cp_rd
|2.2|In the base RV32I ISA, there are four core instruction formats (R/I/S/U)|cp_asm_count
|2.2|Except for the 5-bit immediates used in CSR instructions (Chapter 6), immediates are always sign-extended|cp_imm_corners
|2.2|Each immediate subfield is labeled with the bit position (imm[x]) in
the immediate value being produced.|cp_imm_corners
|2.3|The only difference between the S and B formats is that the 12-bit
immediate field is used to encode branch offsets in multiples of 2 in
the B format. Instead of shifting all bits in the instruction-encoded
immediate left by one in hardware as is conventionally done, the middle
bits (imm[10:1]) and sign bit stay in fixed positions, while the lowest
bit in S format (inst[7]) encodes a high-order bit in B format.|{store/branch}/cp_imm_corners
|2.3|[T]he only difference between the U and J formats is that the
20-bit immediate is shifted left by 12 bits to form U immediates and by
1 bit to form J immediates. The location of instruction bits in the U
and J format immediates is chosen to maximize overlap with the other
formats and with each other.|{lui/jalr}/cp_imm_corners
|2.3|Sign extensions always uses inst[31].|cp_imm_corners
|2.4|Most integer computational instructions operate on XLEN bits of values held in the integer register file.|cp_rs1, cp_rs2, cr_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.4|Integer computational instructions are either encoded as register-immediate operations using the I-type format or as register-register operations using the R-type format.|cp_rs1, cp_cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.4|The destination is register rd for both register-immediate and register-register instructions.|cp_rd
|2.4|No integer computational instructions cause arithmetic exceptions.|untestable
|2.4.1|ADDI adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register _rs1_.
Arithmetic overflow is ignored and the result is simply the low XLEN
bits of the result.|addi/cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.4.1|SLTI (set less than immediate) places the value 1 in register _rd_ if
register _rs1_ is less than the sign-extended immediate when both are
treated as signed numbers, else 0 is written to _rd_.|slti/cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.4.1|SLTIU is similar
but compares the values as unsigned numbers (i.e., the immediate is
first sign-extended to XLEN bits then treated as an unsigned number).|sltiu/cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.4.1|ANDI, ORI, XORI are logical operations that perform bitwise AND, OR, and
XOR on register _rs1_ and the sign-extended 12-bit immediate and place
the result in _rd_.|{andi/ori/xori}/cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.4.1|Shifts by a constant are encoded as a specialization of the I-type
format. The operand to be shifted is in _rs1_, and the shift amount is
encoded in the lower 5 bits of the I-immediate field. The right shift
type is encoded in bit 30. SLLI is a logical left shift (zeros are
shifted into the lower bits); SRLI is a logical right shift (zeros are
shifted into the upper bits); and SRAI is an arithmetic right shift (the
original sign bit is copied into the vacated upper bits).|{slli/srli/srai}/cp_rs1_imm_corners, cp_uimm
|2.4.1|LUI (load upper immediate) is used to build 32-bit constants and uses
the U-type format. LUI places the 32-bit U-immediate value into the
destination register _rd_, filling in the lowest 12 bits with zeros.|lui/cp_imm_corners_20bit, cp_rd
|2.4.1|AUIPC (add upper immediate to `pc`) is used to build `pc`-relative
addresses and uses the U-type format. AUIPC forms a 32-bit offset from
the U-immediate, filling in the lowest 12 bits with zeros, adds this
offset to the address of the AUIPC instruction, then places the result
in register _rd_.|auipc/cp_imm_corners_20bit, cp_rd
|2.4.2|RV32I defines several arithmetic R-type operations. All operations read
the _rs1_ and _rs2_ registers as source operands and write the result
into register _rd_. The _funct7_ and _funct3_ fields select the type of
operation.|cr_rs1_rs2_corners, cp_rs1, cp_rs2, cp_rd
|2.4.2|ADD performs the addition of _rs1_ and _rs2_.|add/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.4.2|SUB performs the
subtraction of _rs2_ from _rs1_. Overflows are ignored and the low XLEN
bits of results are written to the destination _rd_. |sub/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.4.2|SLT and SLTU
perform signed and unsigned compares respectively, writing 1 to _rd_ if
_rs1_ < _rs2_, 0 otherwise.|{slt/sltu}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.4.2|AND, OR, and XOR perform bitwise
logical operations.|{and/or/xor}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.4.2|SLL, SRL, and SRA perform logical left, logical right, and arithmetic
right shifts on the value in register _rs1_ by the shift amount held in
the lower 5 bits of register _rs2_.|{sll/srl/sra}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners, cp_rs2
|2.4.3|The NOP instruction does not change any architecturally visible state,
except for advancing the `pc` and incrementing any applicable
performance counters. NOP is encoded as ADDI _x0, x0, 0_.|addi/cp_rs1_imm_corners
|2.5.1|The jump and link (JAL) instruction uses the J-type format, where the
J-immediate encodes a signed offset in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset
is sign-extended and added to the address of the jump instruction to
form the jump target address.|jal/cp_imm_corners_jal
|2.5.1|Plain unconditional jumps (assembler pseudoinstruction J) are encoded as
a JAL with _rd_=`x0`.|jal/cp_rd
|2.5.1|The indirect jump instruction JALR (jump and link register) uses the
I-type encoding. The target address is obtained by adding the
sign-extended 12-bit I-immediate to the register _rs1_, then setting the
least-significant bit of the result to zero. The address of the
instruction following the jump (`pc`+4) is written to register _rd_.
Register `x0` can be used as the destination if the result is not
required.|jalr/{cp_offset_jalr, cp_rd, cp_imm_corners}
|2.5.2|All branch instructions use the B-type instruction format. The 12-bit
B-immediate encodes signed offsets in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset
is sign-extended and added to the address of the branch instruction to
give the target address.|{beq/bne/blt/bge/bltu/bgeu}/cp_offset, *** more via Issue 717
|2.5.2|BEQ and BNE take the branch
if registers _rs1_ and _rs2_ are equal or unequal respectively.|{beq/bne}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.5.2|BLT and
BLTU take the branch if _rs1_ is less than _rs2_, using signed and
unsigned comparison respectively. |{blt/bltu}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|2.5.2|BGE and BGEU take the branch if _rs1_
is greater than or equal to _rs2_, using signed and unsigned comparison
respectively.|{bge/bgeu}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners

|2.6|The LW instruction loads a 32-bit value from memory into _rd_.|{cp_rd}
|2.6|LH loads
a 16-bit value from memory, then sign-extends to 32-bits before storing
in _rd_. LHU loads a 16-bit value from memory but then zero extends to
32-bits before storing in _rd_. LB and LBU are defined analogously for
8-bit values.|{lh/lhu/lb/lbu}/{cp_rd} hits these with random values ***good enough?
|2.6|The SW, SH, and SB instructions store 32-bit, 16-bit, and

|4.1|RV64I widens the integer registers and supported user address space to 64 bits|cp_rs1, cp_rs2, cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|4.2.1|ADDIW is an RV64I instruction that adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register rs1 and produces the proper sign extension of a 32-bit result in rd. Overflows are ignored and the result is the low 32 bits of the result sign-extended to 64 bits.|cp_rs1_imm_corners
|4.2.1|Shifts by a constant are encoded as a specialization of the I-type format using the same instruction opcode as RV32I. The operand to be shifted is in rs1, and the shift amount is encoded in the lower 6 bits of the I-immediate field for RV64I. The right shift type is encoded in bit 30. SLLI is a logical left shift (zeros are shifted into the lower bits); SRLI is a logical right shift (zeros are shifted into the upper bits); and SRAI is an arithmetic right shift (the original sign bit is copied into the vacated upper bits).|{slli/srli/srai}/cp_rs1_imm_corners, cp_uimm
|4.2.1|SLLIW, SRLIW, and SRAIW are RV64I-only instructions that are analogously
defined but operate on 32-bit values and sign-extend their 32-bit
results to 64 bits.|{slliw/srliw/sraiw}/cp_rs1_imm_corners, cp_uimm
|4.2.1|LUI (load upper immediate) uses the same opcode as RV32I. LUI places the

with zeros. The 32-bit result is sign-extended to 64 bits.|lui/cp_imm_corners_20bit, cp_rd
|4.2.1|AUIPC (add upper immediate to `pc`) uses the same opcode as RV32I. AUIPC
is used to build `pc`-relative addresses and uses the U-type format.
AUIPC forms a 32-bit offset from the U-immediate, filling in the lowest
12 bits with zeros, sign-extends the result to 64 bits, adds it to the
address of the AUIPC instruction, then places the result in register
_rd_.|auipc/cp_imm_corners_20bit, cp_rd
|4.2.2|ADDW and SUBW are RV64I-only instructions that are defined analogously
to ADD and SUB but operate on 32-bit values and produce signed 32-bit
results. Overflows are ignored, and the low 32-bits of the result is
sign-extended to 64-bits and written to the destination register.|{addw/subw}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|4.2.2|SLL, SRL, and SRA perform logical left, logical right, and arithmetic
right shifts on the value in register _rs1_ by the shift amount held in
register _rs2_. In RV64I, only the low 6 bits of _rs2_ are considered
for the shift amount.|{sll/srl/sra}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners
|4.2.2|SLLW, SRLW, and SRAW are RV64I-only instructions that are analogously
defined but operate on 32-bit values and sign-extend their 32-bit
results to 64 bits. The shift amount is given by _rs2[4:0]_.|{sllw/srlw/sraw}/cp_rs1_rs2_corners, cp_rs2

|4.3|The LD instruction loads a 64-bit value from memory into register _rd_
for RV64I.|ld/cp_rd
|4.3|The LW instruction loads a 32-bit value from memory and sign-extends
this to 64 bits before storing it in register _rd_ for RV64I. The LWU
instruction, on the other hand, zero-extends the 32-bit value from
memory for RV64I. LH and LHU are defined analogously for 16-bit values,
as are LB and LBU for 8-bit values.|{lw/lwu/lh/lhu/lb/lbu}/cp_rd, ***sext

=== C Compressed Extension

The C extension is subdivided into Zca, Zcf, and Zcd.  All configurations supporting C contain Zca.  RV32CF configurations also contain Zcf, and RV{32/64}CD configurations also contain Zcd.  A configuration supporting C should test all of the applicable Zc* extensions. <<t-C-normative-statements>> lists the normative statements in the RV{32/64}C specification applicable to all instructions, and the unprivileged coverpoints that exercise them.  Normative statements related to privileged behavior of C instructions are given in <<

=== V Vector Extension

The vector coverpoints are intended to be flexible to support the full V extension, the Zve* embedded vector extensions, and arbitrary mixes of supported vector length (VLEN), element lengths (SEW~MIN~, ELEN), and floating-point precisions.

The vector extension is huge.  The testplan is partitioned into three unprivileged portions discussed here, and three privileged portions (ZicsrV, ExceptionsV, SsstrictV) discussed in XREF.

The full V extension supports all selected element widths SEW={8, 16, 32, 64}.  The vector coverage files and tests are organized by SEW.  Thus, a DUT could handle any contiguous subset of SEW from SEW~MIN~ to ELEN.  For example, a DUT with SEW~MIN~=16 and ELEN=32 would support SEW={16, 32}.

The tests detect VLMAX and set the vector length accordingly, up to some configurable maximum VLEN (default 4096 bits, although the vector extension theoretically supports up to 65536).  Therefore, there is no need for different test suites for different VLENs.

==== Vector File Organization

<<f-vector-organization>> summarizes the structure of the coverpoint and test files for the vector extension.  The unprivileged vector tests are organized by integer (Vx), load/store (Vls), and floating-point (Vf) types of instructions. Each applies to SEW=8, 16, 32, and/or 64. The ExceptionsV, ZicsrV, and SsstrictV privileged tests are described in section XREF.

The vector tests are organized by XLEN=32 and XLEN=64 because the scalar registers behavior differs by XLEN.  For example, vadd.vx with SEW=64 sign-extends XLEN=32 scalar registers but does not modify XLEN=64 scalar registers.  For a given XLEN, the vector tests are organized by type (Vx/Vls/Vf) and SEW (8/16/32/64).  Each directory contains a .S file for every vector instruction of that type footnote:[Certain instructions are omitted if not supported for a given SEW.  For example, widening add vwadd.vv is not supported for SEW=64, and vrgatherei16.v is not supported for SEW=8.].  Vector load/store instructions run with any SEW but also specify EEW as part of the instruction name.  For example, vle8.v and vle16.v can both be executed in either SEW=8 or SEW=16, and the EMUL behavior is different between these modes.  Therefore, all the load/store variants are included in all of Vls{8/16/32/64}.

[NOTE]
====
Vx and Vf are separated because certain extensions such as Zve64x do not support
floating-point.  Vls could be lumped with Vx, but the coverpoints are so different that
it is easier to define the tests separately, and facilitates just running integer vs. load/store tests during development.

When an instruction's EEW is not a supported SEW, the coverage files and tests exclude the instruction from testing.  For example, vwadd.vv is not supported when SEW=32 and ELEN = 32 because it cannot widen to 64 bits.

The tests also account for unsupported register group overlap.  For example, a widening add vwadd.wv v0, v2, v2 is unspported because the source registers cannot be read with different EEWs.  On the other hand vwadd.vv v0, v1, v8 with LMUL=1 is supported even though the destination vd=v0 widens to write [v0-v1], which overlaps with vs2=v1.  The tests exercise all supported overlaps, but do not attempt any unsupported overlaps because the behavior is reserved and unpredictable.

==== Vector Configuration Parameters

The coverpoints and tests are parameterized by the minimum supported element width SEW~MIN~ and the maximum supported element width ELEN.  The coverpoints and tests exclude unsupported corner cases, such as widening to more than ELEN or using LMUL=1/8 with ELEN=32 but SEW~MIN~=8.

==== Vector Coverpoints

Running long vectors is computationally expensive, so only a subset of vectors tests run on mult-element vectors.  Coverpoints for source and destination registers, corner values, etc. run on a vector length of vl = 1.

<<t-vector-coverpoints>> defines the coverpoints used in vector instructions.  Unless otherwise specified, each coverpoint uses vector length vl=1 and length multiplier LMUL=1, no mask (vm=1), and vstart=0. Hence, they act on exactly one vector element. For such coverpoints, instructions that require a mask use v0=0.

As with other unprivileged testplans, an x in the spreadsheet indicates to use the coverpoint.  Other values in the spreadsheet indicate a variant of the coverpoint:

* nv0: Do not include v0 in the coverpoint.  For example, cp_vd_nv0 means that the destination register vd does not include v0.
* emul2: Only exercise even-numbered registers.  For example cp_vs2_emul2 uses vs2={v0, v2, v4, ...v30}.  For corner values, emul2 means the corner value is twice the width of SEW.
* emul4/8: Similar to emul2
* emulf2, emulf4, emulf8: corner values are 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8 the width of SEW.  Used in extension instructions such as vsext.vf2.
* u: Treat immediate as unsigned 0 to 31 rather than signed -16 to +15. For corners, {0, 1, 2, 15, 16, 30, 31}.
* eew1/mm: Mask instructions with 1-bit elements such as vmand.mm use at least vl=8 to operate on multi-bit masks.
* wv: vs2 is double-width and uses emul2 for its corner values.  vs1 is normal width.
* wred: vs1 is double-width and uses emul2 for its corner values.  vs2 is normal width.
* wx: vs2 is double-width and uses emul2 for its corner values.  rs1 is normal width.
* wi/wiu: vs2 is double-width and uses emul2 for its corner values.  immediate is 5 bit signed or unsigned.
* lmul4max/emul4max: maximum LMUL/EMUL is 4 instead of 8.  vwadd.vv uses lmul4max because it cannot accept LMUL=8 widened to 16.  vlseg2e8.v uses emul4max because the number of segments * EMUL cannot exceed 8.
* lmul2max/lmul1max/emul2max/emul1max: see lmul4max
* lte30/.../lte24: Register number is less than or equal to 30, ..., 24.  Used for segmented load/store so segments won't overflow the register file.
* ls_e{8/16/32/64}: load/store corners with EEW=8,...,64.  Used to convert strided loads from elements to bytes.
* ls: load/store corners instead of integer corners: vs2={0, random < 2*VLMAX}.  rs2= {1, 2, -1, -2, 0}
* f: floating-point corners instead of integer corners: ***

The coverpoints for each vector instruction are given in the following sections.

==== Vx

The Vx testplan is the same for SEW={8, 16, 32, 64}.  Each SEW has its own coverage file (e.g. Vx8_coverages.svh) independent of XLEN, as well as tests that depend on XLEN (e.g. rv32/Vx8/vadd.vx.S).

Note that half-precision vector floating-point is part of the Zvfh and Zvfhmin extensions, not the base V extension.  Nevertheless, all of these tests are in the same directory structure, under Vf16. Zvfh uses Vf16 <<t-Vf-coverpoints>> to exercise all floating-point instructions with SEW=16.  Zvfhmin only exercises the widening and narrowing conversions:

== List of Non-deterministic behaviors

* Mask and tail agnostic vector operations
* Traps on misaligned accesses
* TODO
* need more discussion about whether this is a meaningful and usable idea

== To Do

I think we might want to rethink some of our privileged testing structure and switch to having Sm, S, and U testplans/coverpoints/tests instead of lumping most of that into ZicsrM/S/U. I will also be more apparent what is being tested where that way.

Also pull out hint and pause

Test instructions and remove unused coverpoints

=== Current Status

At present, coverpoints and tests are being developed in the https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw-arch-verif/[cvw-arch-verif] repository and being tested on the https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw[CORE-V Wally] processor.  The goal is to be able to certify RVA23S64 as well as spec-compliant machine mode.

This test plan exists in the form of spreadsheets, and is being converted to ASCII Doc.

As of June 2025, all unprivileged and privileged RVA23S64 features have tests hitting 100% of the coverpoints, with the following exceptions:

* The Vector extension is in progress
* Interrupt tests coverpoints complete, tests partially complete
* PMP tests in progress
* Virtual memory: Sv39 and Sv48 100% coverage, Sv48 debugging one coverpoint
* Hypervisor not started

Corresponding RV32 tests are in tests/rv32/I/I-add.S.  Observe how the directed tests align with the coverpoints and bins.  Register numbers and values are randomized unless they are swept by the coverpoint. The RVTEST_SIGUPD macro compares the result against an expected signature produced by a reference model. When register 0 is used, it is loaded with a random value, but hardwired to 0, so the reference model will show that it behaves as 0.
